# Max
Live your life happy.
Live your life contented.
Live your life selfless.
For me, thatâ€™s ideal life. Do not make it complicated. Life is simple; you just need to eliminate what you think is not important. As for me, life is beautiful. Enjoy every gift of it. Happy Bday!

<!-- A list:

1. Yes
1. Maybe
1. I **guess** no
1. Whatever _you_ need

Chaotic list:

- Yes
- Maybe
- I **guess** no
- Whatever _you_ need

Some headings:

# Heading 1

Ooh, so much white space!

## Heading 2

We love it.

### Heading 3

Don't be afraid.

#### Heading 4

Don't use heading 5, you don't need it.

And here is some code:

```bash
build:
  docker run --rm \
    --volume=$(PWD):/srv/jekyll \
    -it jekyll/builder:$(JEKYLL_VERSION) \
    jekyll build
```

Or some inline code: `const fileName = 'do.xml';`.
